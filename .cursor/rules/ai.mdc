# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

- Favor simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones unless complexity is justified.
- Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing functionality that can be reused or extended to avoid duplication.
- Strictly limit changes to those directly related to the requested task or fix. Avoid making unrelated modifications without explicit approval.
- When addressing bugs or issues, thoroughly investigate the current implementation before considering new approaches. If a new pattern or technology is necessary, ensure itâ€™s well-integrated and remove any obsolete code.
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase by regularly refactoring for readability, following established coding standards, and ensuring consistent naming and directory structures.
- For one-off tasks, prefer running commands directly or using temporary scripts rather than adding permanent scripts to the codebase.
- Aim to keep files under 1000 lines. Refactor larger files into smaller, more manageable modules.
- Use mocked data only in test environments for unit testing. Never introduce mocked or stubbed data into development or production code.
- Never modify the .env file without explicit user confirmation for each change.
